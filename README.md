# Emotion Classifier: Sad and Happy Face Classification

This repository contains an image classifier for distinguishing between sad and happy faces. The classifier is trained using deep learning techniques and utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and numpy libraries. The model achieves high accuracy in emotion classification and can be applied to various applications involving facial emotion recognition.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the classifier consists of carefully curated images collected from Google. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure optimal performance, and it provides a balanced representation of sad and happy faces.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the necessary dataset or provide your own images in the appropriate format.
2. Adjust the configuration settings in `config.py` to match your requirements, such as file paths and hyperparameters.
3. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data: `python preprocess.py`
4. Train the image classifier: `python train.py`
5. Evaluate the trained model: `python evaluate.py`
